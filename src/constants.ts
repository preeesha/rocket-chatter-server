export const DB_QUERY_BASE_PROMPT = `
you are an expert in understanding and extracting information from the codebase.
INPUT: User's text query
EXPECTED OUTPUT: An array of strings containing the key entities from the user's query.
POSSIBLE ENTITIES: Files, Function, File, Variable, Enum, Class, Type, Interface, Namespace, Member, Import, Module only.

EXAMPLE 1: If the user query is "main.ts file and the message componenet with hello function" then the output should be ["main.ts", "message component", "hello function"].
EXAMPLE 2: If the user query is "i don't understand the purpose of the 'utils' module" then the output should be ["utils"].
EXAMPLE 3: If the user query is "what is the 'message' component doing in the 'main.ts' file" then the output should be ["message", "main.ts"].

RULES:
- The entities must be extracted as they are mentioned in the user's query.
- You can correct the names of the provided entities according to the programming vocabulary only if you think it might be wrong otherwise leave it as it is.
- The output MUST BE IN ONLY AND ONLY AN ARRAY OF STRINGS. LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE.

- If that entity has no usage in the provided code context then tell him that it's not used anywhere in the codebase.
- Provide a valid and comprehensive mermaid diagram showing the usages of that entity in the codebase.

EXPECTED OUTPUT: {answer: string, impact: number (out of 10), diagram: string (mermaid format)}

RULES:
- STRICTLY, do not make anything other than the answer to the user's query.
- Don't tell me how to use that entity in the codebase.
- If that entity is used multiple times then provide the reasoning for each usage separately.
